This scripts should be run from a fresh Debian 6 "squeeze" installation (if possible with no web server nor ruby version installed from Aptitude)

This script installs ruby1.9.2 with readline compatibility in a RVM environnement (https://rvm.beginrescueend.com/), with all dependancies (from Aptitude).

This script will also install an empty nginx, which is very usefull for proxy_passing your in development apps.

Beware : There are a part which will write on you .bashrc file. If you're using ZSH or other alternate shell, please modify.

Enjoy.
